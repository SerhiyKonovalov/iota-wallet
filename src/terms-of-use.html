									<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) establish the conditions under which you may download, install, and use IOTA Wallet application. By installing or using the wallet on any supported operating system — Windows, macOS, or Linux — you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms in full. If you do not agree with any part of them, you should not use the application.</p>
									<p>IOTA Wallet is a non-custodial, open-source software developed to allow users to securely manage digital assets on the IOTA network. It provides a local interface to generate and store private keys, sign transactions, and interact with the Tangle without relying on centralized servers or third-party intermediaries.</p>
									<p>These Terms are not a financial or contractual agreement between you and the developers. The wallet does not provide banking, exchange, brokerage, or custodial services. It is a standalone software tool distributed freely under an open-source license, allowing anyone to download, inspect, modify, and use it at their own discretion.</p>

									<p>By continuing to use the wallet, you acknowledge that:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">You are solely responsible for how you install, configure, and operate the software.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">You understand that the wallet performs all sensitive operations locally and that your seed phrase and private keys remain exclusively under your control.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">You are aware that the wallet is offered “as is”, with no guarantees of uninterrupted service, compatibility, or performance.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The purpose of this document is to clarify the scope of use, responsibilities, and limitations that apply to all users. It also ensures transparency by describing how the wallet should — and should not — be used within the boundaries of open-source and decentralized principles.</p>

									<p>These Terms apply to:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">The desktop IOTA Wallet software and its distributed packages;</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Any associated documentation, FAQs, or downloadable updates published through official channels;</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">User interactions with the software’s built-in functions and configurations.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>They do not apply to third-party websites, explorers, or nodes you choose to connect to, nor do they extend to any community-managed or external services outside the wallet’s official release.</p>
									<p>IOTA Wallet may evolve over time, introducing improvements, new features, or compatibility adjustments. Updated versions of these Terms will accompany each major release to ensure continued clarity. By using any version of the wallet, you confirm your ongoing acceptance of the Terms relevant to that release.</p>

								<h2 class="terms-content__title">Use of Software</h2>
								<div class="terms-content__text">
									<p>IOTA Wallet is provided as a free, open-source desktop application designed for secure interaction with the IOTA network. It may be used by any individual or organization, provided that such use complies with applicable laws and the principles outlined in these Terms. The software’s open-source nature grants you freedom to install, run, and study its code, but that freedom also carries the responsibility to use it ethically and safely.</p>

									<h3>Permitted Use</h3>
									<p>You are allowed to:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">
											Install and use the wallet for personal, educational, research, or professional purposes.
										</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Create and manage multiple wallet instances on your devices.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Review, audit, and compile the source code in accordance with its open-source license.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Connect to public or private IOTA nodes of your choosing.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Customize local configurations and appearance settings for usability or accessibility reasons.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These actions are considered normal and intended behaviors of the software. You are free to use the wallet in any legitimate way that does not compromise its integrity or the safety of the IOTA network.</p>

									<h3>Prohibited Use</h3>
									<p>You agree not to:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">Use the wallet for any activity that violates laws, regulations, or the rights of others.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Deploy or distribute modified versions of the wallet that include malware, telemetry, or unauthorized tracking code.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Attempt to reverse engineer, exploit, or compromise the application to gain access to other users’ data or private keys.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Use the wallet as part of any automated bot, mining, or spam system targeting the IOTA network.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Interfere with network nodes, manipulate transaction validation, or perform denial-of-service attacks.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Claim, imply, or advertise that the wallet is an official product of a specific organization unless explicitly authorized.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The wallet was created to promote decentralization and user control. Any modification or redistribution that alters these principles — for example, by adding remote data collection, advertising, or closed-source binaries — violates both the Terms of Service and the open-source license under which the wallet is distributed.</p>

									<h3>Third-Party Integrations</h3>
									<p>While the wallet may allow you to connect to third-party services (such as IOTA nodes, hardware wallets, or explorers), those interactions occur outside the control of the wallet developers. You are solely responsible for verifying the authenticity, security, and reliability of such services. The developers do not endorse or guarantee the safety of any third-party component, API, or integration you choose to use.</p>

									<h3>User Responsibility</h3>
									<p>Every action performed within the wallet is executed locally under your control. By using this software, you agree to operate it responsibly and not to introduce modifications or behaviors that could harm the wider network or other users. You also agree that you are solely accountable for maintaining the security of your devices, systems, and network connections while using the wallet.</p>

								<h2 class="terms-content__title">Non-Custodial Nature & User Responsibility</h2>
								<div class="terms-content__text">
									<p>IOTA Wallet is built on a fully non-custodial architecture, meaning all cryptographic materials — private keys, wallet seeds, and encrypted data files — are generated and stored exclusively on your local device. No remote servers or cloud systems are used for key storage or transaction signing. This ensures that full ownership and control remain in the hands of the user, not the developers or any third party.</p>
									<p>When a new wallet is created, all sensitive data is produced locally and never transmitted over the network. Every outgoing transaction is signed within the application using your private keys, then broadcast directly to the IOTA network through the node you select. Because there is no central authority managing user credentials, you remain the only person capable of accessing your wallet or restoring it from backup.</p>
									<p>This decentralized model provides complete freedom, but also full responsibility. The security of your funds depends entirely on your own device security, password hygiene, and backup practices.</p>

									<h3>User Responsibility</h3>
									<p>By using IOTA Wallet, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">You are the sole custodian of your private keys and recovery phrase. Losing them means permanent loss of access to your tokens.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Developers have no technical means to restore or recover your wallet, passwords, or seed phrase — no backups or recovery systems exist.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">You must ensure your device remains free of malware and that your operating system, antivirus, and dependencies are kept up to date.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Running the wallet on shared or compromised hardware increases the risk of unauthorized access, and this risk is entirely your responsibility.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If your device is lost, stolen, or corrupted, recovery is only possible through your personal backup. Storing your recovery phrase online or in cloud storage is strongly discouraged, as anyone who obtains it gains complete control over your assets.</p>

									<h3>Ownership of Assets</h3>
									<p>All digital assets managed through IOTA Wallet belong exclusively to you. The wallet does not hold, transfer, or escrow tokens on your behalf; it simply provides a local interface to sign and send transactions to the IOTA Tangle. No data about your balances, transaction history, or addresses is collected or transmitted to developers. You decide which nodes to connect to and how to interact with the network.</p>
									<p>The wallet is not a financial service, broker, or exchange. It performs no custody, no conversion, and no mediation of funds. All transfers occur directly between network participants, following the immutable logic of the IOTA protocol.</p>

									<h3>Local Security Practices</h3>
									<p>Private keys and recovery data are encrypted using strong, modern cryptographic standards.</p>
									<p>For maximum safety, users are encouraged to:</p>
									<ul class="terms-list">
										<li class="terms-list__item">Keep an offline copy of their recovery phrase written or engraved on a secure medium (paper, metal, etc.).</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Avoid screenshots, cloud storage, and external drives connected to the internet.</li>
										<li class="terms-list__item">Never share wallet data, passwords, or files with any person or third-party service.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>IOTA Wallet does not contain telemetry, analytics, or background synchronization that could compromise privacy or security. All critical processes run locally and terminate immediately when the wallet is closed.</p>

									<h3>User Accountability</h3>
									<p>All transactions on the IOTA network are final and irreversible. Mistakes such as sending tokens to an incorrect address, deleting wallet data, or losing a recovery phrase cannot be undone. There are no centralized systems to appeal to, no password reset, and no technical recovery option. This is a deliberate design choice — decentralization ensures independence, not reliance on third parties.</p>
									<p>By continuing to use the wallet, you agree that <strong>you are fully accountable</strong> for the security of your wallet, your devices, and your actions within the network. The application empowers you with total control, but that control comes with the responsibility to protect your digital assets at all times.</p>
