										<p>IOTA Wallet is a community-maintained, open-source software project distributed globally without affiliation to any specific company, country, or governing entity. It operates as decentralized code, shared under a public license, and is not subject to the jurisdiction or commercial regulation of any single state. By using or redistributing this software, users and contributors acknowledge that they do so voluntarily and in accordance with the laws applicable in their own regions.</p>
										<p>The wallet does not provide financial, custodial, or exchange services. It functions solely as a client-side tool that allows interaction with the IOTA distributed ledger. Because it does not involve intermediaries, registration, or managed infrastructure, there is no centralized legal responsibility for its operation. Every participant acts independently when downloading, compiling, or using the codebase.</p>
										<p>The project is guided by <strong>internationally recognized open-source principles</strong>, not by local or corporate legal frameworks. This includes the ideas of:</p>
										<h3>Foundation Objectives</h3>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item"><strong>Transparency</strong>
												the source code is public and verifiable by anyone.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item"><strong>Accessibility</strong>
												the software can be freely obtained, reviewed, and modified.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item"><strong>Neutrality</strong>
												it may be used worldwide, regardless of political or jurisdictional boundaries.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>All users are responsible for ensuring that the use of non-custodial wallets and distributed ledger technology complies with the laws and regulations of their respective countries. If national or regional restrictions apply to digital assets, cryptography, or peer-to-peer networks, users must comply with such restrictions on their own initiative.</p>
										<p>The maintainers and contributors of the project do not offer legal advice and are not responsible for determining the legality of blockchain activity in any jurisdiction.Each user, organization, or developer who interacts with IOTA Wallet accepts full responsibility for understanding and following their local compliance requirements.</p>
										<p>This approach reflects the <strong>borderless and permissionless nature of the IOTA ecosystem</strong>. The wallet can be developed, used, or improved from any location in the world, and no single court, authority, or government defines or governs its scope.</p>

									<div class="regulatory-card__content">
										<p>IOTA Wallet is distributed under a permissive open-source license that grants users broad freedom to use, study, modify, and share the software. All source code, build configurations, and related documentation are publicly accessible and maintained in repositories governed by community contribution standards. The code is provided to encourage innovation and interoperability within the IOTA ecosystem and the wider decentralized software landscape.</p>
										<p>Ownership of individual code contributions remains with their respective authors. By contributing to the repository, developers agree to license their work under the same open-source terms that apply to the project as a whole. This ensures that all derived or redistributed versions remain transparent and compatible with the spirit of the original software.</p>
										<p>The license grants you the right to:</p>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												<strong>Run</strong> the software for any purpose, whether personal, educational, or commercial.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												<strong>Modify</strong> the source code to adapt it to your needs or to build derivative works.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												<strong>Distribute</strong> copies of the software, in whole or in part, as long as license notices and attribution are preserved.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												<strong>Study and verify</strong> how the software operates, including its cryptographic and networking components.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>These rights are universal and irrevocable, provided that the license conditions are respected. No royalties, fees, or permissions are required to use or modify the wallet code.</p>

										<h3>Limitations of License</h3>
										<p>While the license provides broad rights, it does not grant:</p>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Ownership or exclusivity over the IOTA Wallet name, logo, or design assets.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												The right to distribute closed-source versions under the same branding.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Any warranty or guarantee of performance, security, or reliability.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Immunity from local laws regulating cryptographic tools or digital assets.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>If you modify or redistribute the software, you must clearly indicate changes and avoid presenting derivative works as official releases. Attribution to the original source must remain visible in the documentation and software metadata.</p>
										<p>The open-source license protects the software from proprietary enclosure while ensuring that everyone can benefit from transparency, shared knowledge, and verifiable code. Users and developers are encouraged to review the license file included with the distribution package for exact legal language.</p>

										<h3>Intellectual Property Boundaries</h3>
										<p>All original code, configuration files, and design elements created specifically for IOTA Wallet are subject to copyright by their contributors and are released under the terms of the project’s license. External libraries or third-party modules included in the build are governed by their own respective licenses, which remain valid and binding. Nothing in this section transfers intellectual property rights beyond the scope explicitly defined by the open-source license.</p>

										<p>The name <strong>“IOTA Wallet”</strong>, along with its associated visual identity — including the logo, color palette, and user interface design — represents the identity of this open-source project within the IOTA ecosystem. While the code is freely available under an open-source license, the visual presentation and naming conventions are protected to prevent misuse, impersonation, or confusion among users.</p>
										<p>The project’s naming and design elements may be referenced in documentation, research, and derivative works only for descriptive or educational purposes, provided that such references do not imply official affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship by the original developers or community maintainers.</p>

										<h3>Permitted Usage</h3>
										<p>You may:</p>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Refer to IOTA Wallet in technical documentation, articles, and tutorials for clarity or comparison.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Include screenshots or interface snippets in educational content, as long as they are unaltered and properly attributed.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Indicate that your project or fork is “based on” or “inspired by” IOTA Wallet, provided the distinction is clearly visible.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Such uses are encouraged when they contribute to transparency, research, or user education within the blockchain community.</p>

										<h3>Prohibited Usage</h3>
										<p>You may not:</p>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">Use the IOTA Wallet name or logo in a way that could mislead users into believing your version, fork, or product is an official release.</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">Distribute modified builds under the same name or branding.</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">Use visual elements (icons, colors, layouts) to impersonate the official application for phishing, data collection, or commercial gain.</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">Register or attempt to trademark any variation of the name “IOTA Wallet” in any jurisdiction.</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">Include advertising, monetization, or closed-source elements under the same identity.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>If you publish a fork, modification, or derivative build, it must carry a distinct name, visual style, and description to prevent confusion. This preserves trust and clarity for end users while allowing development freedom.</p>

										<h3>Brand Integrity</h3>
										<p>Maintaining consistent branding ensures users can identify authentic builds and avoid malicious imitations. To support this, official releases use verified distribution channels and cryptographic signatures. Community members are encouraged to verify checksums, review repositories, and avoid unofficial downloads promoted under the IOTA Wallet identity.</p>
										<p>The brand identity exists solely to distinguish the legitimate open-source project — not to restrict collaboration or innovation. Derivative works may freely evolve, but they must do so transparently, under their own names and visual identities.</p>

									<h2 class="regulatory-card__title">Third-Party Components & Dependencies</h2>
									<div class="regulatory-card__content">
										<p>IOTA Wallet integrates several <strong>third-party components and open-source libraries</strong> that enable cryptographic operations, data serialization, network communication, and user interface functionality. These components are developed and maintained by independent contributors and are distributed under their respective open-source licenses, which remain valid and binding regardless of the IOTA Wallet’s own license.</p>
										<p>Each third-party dependency included in the build is carefully reviewed for stability, security, and compliance with open-source principles. However, because these external projects evolve independently, their terms, updates, and performance are outside the direct control of IOTA Wallet maintainers.</p>

										<h3>Nature of Third-Party Software</h3>
										<p>The software ecosystem used by IOTA Wallet may include, but is not limited to:</p>
										<ul class="regulatory-list">
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Cryptographic libraries for key management and hashing functions.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Networking modules for peer-to-peer communication with IOTA nodes.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Frameworks for rendering user interfaces across supported desktop platforms.
											</li>
											<li class="regulatory-list__item">
												Compression, serialization, or file-handling utilities.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>All such components are publicly documented and licensed by their respective authors under open standards such as MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL-compatible licenses. Users and developers are encouraged to review these licenses when redistributing, modifying, or compiling the wallet from source.</p>

										<h3>License Compatibility</h3>
										<p>The inclusion of external dependencies does not alter or override the IOTA Wallet’s primary license. Each component retains its own legal terms, and users are responsible for understanding and respecting them when reusing or extending the codebase. If you redistribute the wallet or parts of its source code, you must also include the original copyright notices and license references for all bundled dependencies.</p>
										<p>When building or compiling the project manually, developers should ensure that all third-party modules are obtained from verified repositories and remain consistent with their official releases. This helps maintain software integrity, avoids dependency conflicts, and ensures long-term security.</p>

										<h3>External Services and APIs</h3>
										<p>Certain optional features may interact with external APIs, such as blockchain explorers, data providers, or hardware wallet integrations. These services are not part of the IOTA Wallet itself and are governed by their own privacy and usage policies. Connecting to third-party endpoints is at the user’s discretion, and such usage does not create any legal or operational responsibility for the wallet developers.</p>
										<p>The inclusion of an integration does not constitute endorsement of the external service. Users should independently verify its trustworthiness, security, and compliance before use.</p>
